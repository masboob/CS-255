System Analysis &amp; Design

DriverPass is a system that allows prospective drivers to schedule, study, and pay for classes. The client is the owner of DriverPass. 
DriverPass wanted a system that had levels of users that could access various types of content. The users are able to schedule in-person training for driving. The system is meant to manage all of their services with ease. 

I believe I created the UML diagrams well. They are easy to read and understand. The interviews I read helped a lot when creating the diagrams. That being said, I would revise the complexity of my UML use case diagram. My case diagram was quite complex and involved a lot of functions that can be confusing to the reader. If I were to revise it, I would make it less complex. 

I began by thoroughly reviewing the interview transcript, and making note of any statements that could be translated into specific project deliverables. Once I had compiled a comprehensive list, I started to consider how these deliverables could be implemented through software or whether they required external components. If an item on the list had external dependencies, I set it aside and focused on those with a clear software application.

When I encountered more abstract requirements, such as "security," I turned to research to identify the optimal solutions. Next, I needed to incorporate these solutions into the design. To do so, I broke them down into their fundamental components and created use cases for each. Then, to reintroduce complexity, I integrated the "include" and "extend" relationships.

An essential aspect of the design process is prioritizing the user's needs, as it ensures that the final product aligns with the client's specific requests. For instance, in this project, a crucial consideration was the availability of downloadable content for select users. Failing to incorporate a login system or tiered user access would result in unrestricted access to premium content, undermining the purpose of offering exclusive materials. Accounting for the user's needs during the design phase can prevent extensive revisions later on and contribute to client satisfaction.

To design software effectively, start by gathering and documenting project requirements, engaging with stakeholders, and clarifying any ambiguities. Identify key use cases to understand user interactions and guide the design process. These steps are fundamental to creating software that meets its objectives and user needs.
